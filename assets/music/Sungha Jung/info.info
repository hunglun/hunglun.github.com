The following is the musician’s statement of Sungha Jung:

Hi, I’m Sungha Jung from South Korea. My dream is to become a professional acoustic fingerstyle guitarist.

I had been watching my dad play the guitar for awhile before I finally jumped on it myself two years ago. I just turned eleven in September, 2007.

Currently, I am taking weekly classical guitar lessons and teaching myself fingerstyle guitar.

I used to not have tabs for the music that I played in my videos. I just listen and pick them up directly from the sound source in videos available on the internet. However, recently, I have started playing with original tabs whenever they are available to me by courtesy of the authors.

My guitar is custom made to fit my body size, and on it, Thomas Leeb wrote "Keep on grooving to my friend."

I’m very grateful to those prominent guitarists who have had a great influence on my guitar playing. I’ll continue to study them and learn more about interpretation of music and various playing techniques.

My daily practice routine lasts for one to two hours when school is open, but I play up to three hours a day during the school breaks.

It usually takes me two to three days to practice and videotape a new piece but sometimes up to a week for more difficult ones.

Last, but certainly not least, I can’t thank Ulli Bögershausen enough for being my musical inspiration.

I have composed two pieces, ’Missing You’ and recently ’Voyages with Ulli.’ And I arranged one of my favorite songs ’Fields of Gold’ by Sting. I will have the tabs for those songs available soon.

Please do not ask me for tabs other than my own arrangement or composition. I suggest you to contact the person whoever composed or arranged the song.
